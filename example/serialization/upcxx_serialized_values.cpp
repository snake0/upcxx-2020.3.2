/*
 * This example illustrates the use of UPCXX_SERIALIZED_VALUES to serialize an
 * object captured by a call to upcxx::rpc.
 *
 * This example computes a sum reduction across all ranks of the values
 * contained in the 'values' array, which is a field of the class
 * dist_reduction. The local/partial sum reduction is computed in the call to
 * UPCXX_SERIALIZED_VALUES when an instance of dist_reduction is captured by a
 * call to upcxx::rpc. Each rank sends an RPC to rank 0, which implicitly first
 * computes a local sum reduction and then a global sum reduction on rank 0.
 * UPCXX_SERIALIZED_VALUES allows us to only send a single double (the result of
 * the local sum reduction) rather than the entire dist_reduction object.
 *
 * This is an example of subset serialization, in which a proper subset of
 * fields is sent without mutation in order to reduce communication costs.
 * Hence, the full object state is not transmitted and the RPCs transmitting
 * these objects must be aware of this so that they do not try to access
 * invalid/uninitialized state.
