/*
 * This example illustrates the use of UPCXX_SERIALIZED_FIELDS to serialize an
 * object captured by a call to upcxx::rpc.
 *
 * This example computes a sum reduction across all ranks of the values
 * contained in the 'values' array, which is a field of the class
 * dist_reduction. The local/partial sum reduction is computed in to the field
 * 'partial_sum_reduction', and then an object of type dist_reduction is sent
 * from each rank to rank 0 where the global reduction is computed. Using
 * UPCXX_SERIALIZED_FIELDS allows us to only send the 'partial_sum_reduction'
 * field of dist_reduction, and not the entire 'values' field. This
 * significantly reduces the number of bytes sent over the wire.
 *
 * This is an example of subset serialization, in which a proper subset of
 * fields is sent without mutation in order to reduce communication costs.
 * Hence, the full object state is not transmitted and the RPCs transmitting
 * these objects must be aware of this so that they do not try to access
 * invalid/uninitialized state.
